				<h1>We have seen that having a
                    master’s degree is a potential risk
                    for acquiring another one. What is
                    your opinion about this?</h1>

				<button class="answer-button" id="option1">I have the opposite opinion.
                    Having one master’s degree is
                    proof that I’m able to focus on
                    academic activities.</button>
				<button class="answer-button" id="option2">I agree with you. When things are
                    getting complicated I may lose
                    motivation because I already have
                    a master’s degree.</button>

                    that way.</button>
